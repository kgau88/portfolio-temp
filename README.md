Note from the Author: Hi! I designed this e-portfolio website template for the Women in Computer Science club, as we are teaching web development to fellow high school students and want to provide a space for students to publish their work and share more about themselves with their peers as they prepare for university. It is an intuitive and minimalistic blueprint for students, but with easy ways to personalize it. The template includes comments throughout to guide students along the way. Enjoy! - kagu
